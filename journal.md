### Week 02
- Started exercises in Chapter 2. Stopped mid-week at section 2.5, page 81
- organized all codes into dir by chapters
- completed Case Study 1 and Case Study 2 of C Alogrithms
- learnt to break down problem statements to pseudocodes into sequential, selection and iterative structures
- learnt about cast operands which temporary explicitly converts the datatypes of variables into another datatype (e.g int to float)

### Week 01
- Cloned the repository: [CHowToProgram](https://github.com/pdeitel/CHowToProgram8e.git)
- Used the following compiler:
  ```
  Apple clang version 14.0.3 (clang-1403.0.22.14.1)
  Target: arm64-apple-darwin24.1.0
  Thread model: posix
  InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
  ```
- Compiled `GuessNumber.c` into an executable named `GuessNumber`.
- Modified `GuessNumber.c` to print the answer before running in `examples/ch01`.
