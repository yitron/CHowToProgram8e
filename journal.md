## C How to Program (8th Edition) - Paul & Harvey Deitel

### Week 05
- added Chapter 4's example codes into repo
- learnt for, while, do..while control flow
- learnt flow control statements in break and continue
- learnt logical AND `&&`, logical OR `||`, logical Negation `!` commands that evaluates conditions
- explored header files in the std library but compiling with the `-H` flag for the paths
- started Chapter 5 in C function structures
- learnt how an OS will interact with stacking and returning of values in C
- learnt that `function prototypes` is declared for type checking, however concrete definitions is declared in a separate function
- both prototypes and concrete definitions must have identical identifies, and data types in its headers.
- learnt that `.h` header function protypes do no need to be compiled

### Week 04
- completed up to 2.16 of chapter 2's exercises

### Week 03
- completed Chapter 2's exercises
- completed Chapter 3 contents
- need to understand what are platform integer limits to prevent overflow as it may pose a security attack

### Week 02
- Started exercises in Chapter 2. Stopped mid-week at section 2.5, page 81
- organized all codes into dir by chapters
- completed Case Study 1 and Case Study 2 of C Alogrithms
- learnt to break down problem statements to pseudocodes into sequential, selection and iterative structures
- learnt about cast operands which temporary explicitly converts the datatypes of variables into another datatype (e.g int to float)

### Week 01
- Cloned the repository: [CHowToProgram](https://github.com/pdeitel/CHowToProgram8e.git)
- Used the following compiler:
  ```
  Apple clang version 14.0.3 (clang-1403.0.22.14.1)
  Target: arm64-apple-darwin24.1.0
  Thread model: posix
  InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
  ```
- Compiled `GuessNumber.c` into an executable named `GuessNumber`.
- Modified `GuessNumber.c` to print the answer before running in `examples/ch01`.
